### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**Pembrolizumab/Pembrolizumab** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on medicine
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying to become an IT specialist
-->ğŸš§ **My tasks for the near future:**
<!-- TODO-IST:START -->
* [x] Upgrade mine profile on Github
* [ ] Take a course on Git on Slurm
* [ ] Create mine first project on Github
<!-- TODO-IST:END -->
